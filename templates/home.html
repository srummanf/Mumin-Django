                    of sheepskin boots and hope. He fell in love with the sheepskin experience and was convinced the
                    world would one day share this love. The beaches of Southern California had long been an epicenter
                    of a relaxed, casual lifestyle, a lifestyle that Brian felt was a perfect fit for his brand. So he
                    founded the UGG brand, began selling his sheepskin boots and they were an immediate sensation. By
                    the mid 1980's, the UGG brand became a symbol of relaxed southern California culture, gaining
                    momentum through surf shops and other shops up and down the coast of California, from San Diego to
                    Santa Cruz. UGG boots reached beyond the beach, popping up in big cities and small towns all over,
                    and in every level of society. Girls wore their surfer boyfriend's pair of UGG boots like a
                    letterman jacket. When winter came along, UGG boots were in ski shops and were seen in lodges from
                    Mammoth to Aspen.</p> -->

                    by the early 2000's, UGG Australia began to take it by storm. The evolution of UGG from a brand that
                    made sheepskin boots, slippers, clogs and sandals for an active, outdoor lifestyle to a brand that
                    was now being touted as a symbol of a stylish, casual and luxurious lifestyle was swift. Much of
                    this was due to a brand repositioning effort that transformed UGG into a high-end luxury footwear
                    maker. As a fashion brand, UGG advertisements now graced the pages of Vogue Magazine as well as
                    other fashion books. In the mid 2000's, the desire for premium casual fashion was popping up all
                    over the world and UGG was now perfectly aligned with this movement.</p> -->
                <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
                <p class="margin-top-10">Fueled by celebrities from coast to coast wearing UGG boots and slippers on
                    their downtime, an entirely new era of fashion was carved out. As a result, the desire and love for
                    UGG increased as people wanted to go deeper into this relaxed UGG experience. UGG began offering
                    numerous color and style variations on their sheepskin boots and slippers. Cold weather boots for
                    women and men and leather casuals were added with great success. What started as a niche item, UGG
                    sheepskin boots were now a must-have staple in everyone's wardrobe. More UGG collections followed,
                    showcasing everything from knit boots to sneakers to wedges, all the while maintaining that
                    luxurious feel UGG is known for all over the world. UGG products were now seen on runways and in
                    fashion shoots from coast to coast. Before long, the love spread even further.</p>

                    stylish casual movement and demand for premium casual fashion. UGG boots and shoes were now seen
                    walking the streets of London, Paris and Amsterdam with regularity. To meet the rising demand from
                    new fans, UGG opened flagship stores in the UK and an additional location in Moscow. As the love
                    spread farther East, concept stores were opened in Beijing, Shanghai and Tokyo. UGG Australia is now
                    an international brand that is loved by all. This love is a result of a magical combination of the
                    amazing functional benefits of sheepskin and the heightened emotional feeling you get when you slip
                    them on your feet. In short, you just feel better all over when you wear UGG boots, slippers, and
